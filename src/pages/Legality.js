          <h3>1. Chess as a Game of Skill</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Chess is universally acknowledged as a <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'white' }}>game of skill</span> requiring intellectual effort, strategy, and decision-making abilities.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Unlike games of chance, Chess demands continuous focus, calculation, and analytical ability, with outcomes dependent on the skill and proficiency of the player.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Judicial precedents in India, including rulings of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and several High Courts, have consistently held that <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'white' }}>games of skill are exempt from the definition of 'gambling' under Indian law</span>.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Chess tournaments conducted on <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'white' }}>MyChessCircle are legal and permissible</span> under Indian law.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. E-Sports Classification</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>‚Ä¢ The Government of India has recognized <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'white' }}>E-Sports as a legitimate sporting activity</span> and is actively promoting digital sports as part of the country's sporting ecosystem.</li>

            <li>‚Ä¢ Platform fees collected from participants are for tournament facilitation and administrative costs. Rewards are distributed strictly in accordance with pre-declared tournament rules.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ No betting, wagering, or games of chance are offered on our platform.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Compliance with Indian Laws</h3>
