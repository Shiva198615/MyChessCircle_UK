          <h3>Difference Between RMG & E-Sports in India</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>RMG (Real Money Gaming):</span>
              <ul>
                <li>• Players stake money directly to play.</li>
                <li>• Winnings come from pooled entry fees.</li>
                <li>• Subject to strict regulations, high GST (28%), and, in some states, completely banned.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>E-Sports:</span>
              <ul>
                <li>• Recognized by the Govt. of India under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports (since Dec 2022).</li>
                <li>• Involves skill-based competitive play (Chess qualifies).</li>
                <li>• Players/teams usually pay platform fees (like a tournament ticket), or play free-to-enter.</li>
                <li>• Winnings are considered prize money, not gambling.</li>
                <li>• Platforms can charge platform fees, sponsorships, and ad revenue, which is safer legally.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
