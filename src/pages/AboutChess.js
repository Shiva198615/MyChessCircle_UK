          <h2>Rules of Chess</h2>
          <div className="rules-content">
            <div className="rules-text">
              <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8√ó8 grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, 
                two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.</p>
              <p>The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack and there is no way for it to escape.</p>
              <p>There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>
              <h3>Basic Rules:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The player with the white pieces always moves first.</li>
                <li>Players alternate turns, with one piece moved each turn (except for castling).</li>
                <li>Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured.</li>
                <li>Each piece has its own way of moving.</li>
                <li>When a king is under immediate attack, it is said to be in check.</li>
                <li>When a king is in check and there is no legal move to escape, it is checkmate and the game is over.</li>
              </ul>
